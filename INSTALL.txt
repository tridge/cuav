Slightly more detailed installation instructions are available here:

http://diydrones.com/profiles/blog/show?id=705844%3ABlogPost%3A1296458

For the impatient Ubuntu/pip user: 

1) Use apt to install the operating system pre-requsites:

  sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-matplotlib python-numpy python-pyexiv2 python-opencv python-httplib2 libjpeg-turbo-progs

2) Use pip to install the python package dependancies:

  pip install -r requirements.txt


For developers:

To build:

  python setup.py build

Which requires also:

  sudo apt-get install libusb1.0.0-dev libdc1394-22-dev nasm

It also requires the libjpeg-turbo headers. There is an issue with the
libjpeg-turbo8-dev package on 64 bit Ubuntu only including the .a
library and not the (required) shared object. In this case, you need to
build your own libjpev-turbo from sources.

Rather than following the build instructions here:

  http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/

First remoge libjpeg-turbo-progs

 > sudo apt-get remove libjpeg-turbo-progs

then build it with the following:

 > svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/libjpeg-turbo/code/trunk libjpeg-turbo
 > cd libjpeg-turbo
 > autoreconf -fiv
 > ./configure --with-jpeg8
 > make
 > sudo make install

The virtualgl.org build system passes --with-java to ./configure
(causing it to fail unless you have the appropriate java stack) and also
fails to pass --with-jpeg8, which we require,

After installing, you may need to update your ldconfig. For example add
the following line to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_64-linux-gnu.conf

 /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib64

then run 

 sudo ldconfig
